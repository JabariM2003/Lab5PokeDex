# Lab5PokeDex
Issue #1. Getting just the name of the Pokemon instead of all of the information
  This was not difficult it just required me to find the endpoint with the least information which ended up being /pokemon-form/

Issue #2. Getting the JSON to be an object so I can grab just the name
  This also wasn't difficult but I needed to find a package that would help me deserialize the JSON, which luckily one of my friends has done this before and told me a good package to use, and I looked at the documentation to figure out the rest.

Issue #3. The names take too long to display
  This issue I was not able to correct but essentially my code gets through the loop and back to the general menu before even printing the pokemon you're grabbing.
